# Ny's To-Do List
WoW addon for retail and classic

![Preview](https://github.com/Ny0n/Nys_ToDoList/blob/main/.other/previews/previewBase.png?raw=true)

This addon provides a simple list where you can view and store all your to-do's,
and everything can be sorted as daily or weekly, in which case it will reset automatically when the time comes!
You also have the possibility to favorite / add descriptions on items, and even create custom tabs with custom resets.

You can also switch to a clear theme. Itâ€™s just a visual style, so feel free to choose it if you prefer the look!

If you are having any problems, type **/tdl help** to print help in the chat, it will surely give you the answers you are looking for.

#### **How to toggle:**

- Minimap button (the default)
- Key binding
- Databroker plugin
- Normal button that you can place anywhere on your screen
- The "/tdl" chat command

#### **Ny's To-Do List Backup**

The download also includes a second addon, a backup manager.
You can toggle the backup list either by going into the addon options, or by using the "/tdlb" chat command.

This backup list allows you to create and restore backups whenever you want, and it also has an automatic backup section.

*Backups add a layer of protection in case something goes wrong with Ny's To-Do List, but don't forget to also back up your saved variables folder from time to time!*
