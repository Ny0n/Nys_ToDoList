# Ny's To-Do List
WoW addon for retail

![Preview](https://github.com/Ny0n/Nys_ToDoList/blob/main/.other/previews/previewBase.png?raw=true)

This addon provides a simple frame where you can view and store all your to-do's,
and everything can be sorted as daily or weekly, in which case it will reset automatically when the time comes!
You also have the possibility to favorite items, and even put descriptions on them if you need to.

If you are having any problems, tap the information button on the list to print help in the chat, it will surely give you the answers you are looking for.

#### **How to toggle:**

- Minimap button (the default)
- Key binding
- Databroker plugin
- Normal button that you can place anywhere on your screen
- "/tdl" Chat command
