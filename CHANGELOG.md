#### **7.0**

Introducing a brand new and reworked UI!

- Updated the interface to be more in the Dragonflight theme (more in the Classic theme for classic versions)
- Added word wrapping. This means no more entry size limit! (though they will only wrap for a maximum of 3 lines)
- Added a font size option (The list's size is now independent from the font size)
- Added a new button that allows you to hide the menu, for an optimal viewing experience (in the future, this button will allow for an even more optimized viewing experience! \**wink-wink*\*)
- Reworked the way to add items to categories
- Reworked the menu (layout, buttons, completion numbers, sub-menus & moved the frame options to the addon options)
- Reworked the tooltips
- Added the current global / profile state to the list's title
- Miscellaneous improvements
- As always, please do not hesitate to post comments if there are any bugs, or if you want to provide feedback!
