#### **6.0**

Reworked the addon a lot, so that I could add new features that were almost impossible to do with the previous code.

For this update, the main new features include:

- a new "edit mode" to delete, fav, desc, and do a lot more (no more holding keys to do stuff)
- drag and drop is here! you can reorder categories and items just by dragging them (in edit mode)
- tabs have been reworked, this means you can now customize them! you can create new ones, rename them, customize their auto-reset times, change what they show... (this is all in the addon options)

- names are (finally) no longer unique
- categories and items are now individual entities, this means that categories are not "created" by items like it was before
- the list, description frames and tdl button now take the focus when we click on them (they jump in front of every other frame)

- the addon is now way more optimized than it was before (still, do not add 2000 items in one tab :D)
- Miscellaneous improvements

- As always, please do not hesitate to post comments if there are any bugs, or if you want to provide feedback!

This was a big update and addon rework, I redid a lot of systems, this means a lot of new asked for features are already planned and will be coming in future updates (sub-categories, global tabs, import/export, simplified view, list in databroker, and more!)
