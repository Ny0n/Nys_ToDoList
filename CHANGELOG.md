#### **6.1**

- Added an option to enable a tooltip that displays the item's description when hovering the icon (ON by default)
- Miscellaneous changes to adapt for localizations
- Added localization for Brazilian Portuguese (ptBR)

#### **6.0.2**

Reworked the addon a lot, so that I could finally add cool new features:

- A new "edit mode" to delete, fav, desc, and do a lot more (no more holding keys to do stuff)
- Drag and drop is here! you can reorder categories and items just by dragging them (in edit mode)
- Tabs have been reworked! e.g. you can create new ones, customize their reset times, and do a lot more (this is all in the addon options)
- The list, description frames and TDL button now take the focus when we click on them (they jump in front of every other frame)
- Names are (finally) no longer unique
- Categories and items are now individual entities, this means that categories are not "created" by items like it was before
- The addon is now way more optimized (still, do not add 1000 items in one tab :D)
- Miscellaneous improvements (also reworked localization phrases)
- As always, please do not hesitate to post comments if there are any bugs, or if you want to provide feedback!

This was a big update and addon rework, I redid a lot of systems, this means a lot of new asked for features are already planned and will be coming in future updates (sub-categories, global tabs, simplified view, import/export, list in databroker, and more!)
