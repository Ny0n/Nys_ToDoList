# build folder

- This folder holds the "build.sh" script, which is used to manage, package and publish the addon

- **./build.sh --help** for usage

- It is used mainly to package the addon locally for testing, or to publish the addon to GitHub and CurseForge

- The variables at the top of the script can be modified to suit other addon needs
